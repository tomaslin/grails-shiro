Test project for the provided wildcard realm. You should generate the required
artifacts first by running

    grails shiro-quick-start

It would be a good idea to remove ShiroSecurityFilters.groovy from grails-app/conf
at this point. You can then run the tests.

The tests should also be run against

  grails shiro-quick-start --prefix=org.example.Shiro

to ensure that the package handling is working. The BootStrap class is already
set up for the 'org.example' package so you don't need to do anything there.
